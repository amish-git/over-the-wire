Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties:

human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable
Commands you may need to solve this level
ls , cd , cat , file , du , find


For finding non-executable files, the find command can be used. It has the -executable flag, which searches for executable files and allows operators like ‘!’ for negation.

Some additional interesting flags for find:

It has a flag for looking at file size in bytes -size <bytes>.
It also has the option to only look at files -type f (no directories/non-executables).
It has a -readable flag, but this means you have the permission to read the files, not that they are human-readable.
Instead, we could use the -exec <command> flag with '{}' as a path, meaning the chosen command will be executed on all the files. 
This could be used to execute another command like file.


SOLUTION:

bandit5@bandit:~$  cd inhere

bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$  ls
maybehere00  maybehere03  maybehere06  maybehere09  maybehere12  maybehere15  maybehere18
maybehere01  maybehere04  maybehere07  maybehere10  maybehere13  maybehere16  maybehere19
maybehere02  maybehere05  maybehere08  maybehere11  maybehere14  maybehere17

find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file '{}' \; | grep ASCII
OR
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find . -type f -size 1033c 
./maybehere07/.file2

cat ./maybehere07/.file2
