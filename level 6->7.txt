owned by user bandit7
owned by group bandit6
33 bytes in size
Commands you may need to solve this level
ls , cd , cat , file , du , find , grep


Solution:

find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 32c 2>/dev/null

Command Explanation
/ : Search the entire server (/ is the root directory on Linux similar to the C:/ Drive on Windows)
-type f : Search only for files (Exclude Directories)
-user bandit7 : Search for files which are owned by user bandit7
-group bandit6 : Search for files that belongs to the group bandit6
-size 33c : Look for files that are exactly 33 bytes in size (Find uses “c” to represent size in bytes)
