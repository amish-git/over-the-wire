LEVEL GOAL

The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

Commands you may need to solve this level
ls , cd , cat , file , du , find


Theory:

To traverse the directories, the “change directory” command exists: cd <path>.

Interesting uses of the command are:

cd .. goes to the parent directory
cd / goes to the root directory
cd ~ goes to the home directory (of the current user)


A hidden file in Linux starts with a .. The "ls" command shows only non-hidden files. 
However, with the "-a" flag it shows all files, specifically also the hidden files.

The first two hidden entries in the directories stand for the current (.) and the parent 
directory.

SOLUTION:

cd inhere
ls -al
cat .hidden
